# noise_level_detection  

A noise level detection code is a software program that uses a microphone or other audio input device to measure the volume of ambient sound in a particular environment. The code typically analyzes the audio signal in real-time and calculates the sound pressure level (SPL) in decibels (dB). It may also include additional features, such as filtering out background noise or setting threshold levels to trigger alerts when the noise level exceeds a certain limit. The code can be useful for applications such as monitoring noise pollution, controlling noise levels in workplaces or public spaces, or providing feedback on the noise level in a recording or performance environment.
